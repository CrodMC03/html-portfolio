<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a management analyst for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (M&RA), in
  the Manpower, Analytics, & HR Systems (MAHRS) Directorate.  I'm assigned to the Total Force and
  HR Business Intelligence Division, Data Science Branch, and our mission is to develop, deliver, and sustain
  Human Capital business intelligence and tools to improve and support data-driven decision making across the total
  force (Department of the Navy and Marine Corps).
</p>

<p>I perform the duties of a management analyst and project manager for or Directorate's data science initiatives while concurrently
  completing the education requirements needed to meet the OPM qualification standard to eventually serve in a data scientist role.
  My efforts in pursuing graduate education in Data Science has thus far increased my teamâ€™s ability to meet our strategic 
  organizational goals in the areas of data manipulation using Python or R programing languages within a Databricks environment.</p>
